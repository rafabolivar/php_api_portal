# php_api_portal

This little example demonstrates how to use API Calls to Prism Central, using PHP.

The AIM of this usage is to allow MSPs/ISPs to create their own tailored portal for their customers.

To use this code, simply download and modify the parameters in ***createvm.php*** to adjust to your cluster, networks, vm sizes.

To deploy with Calm, just download the blueprint called ***ISP_Portal_Blueprint.json*** and upload it to your Calm environment.
